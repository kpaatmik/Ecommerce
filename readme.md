# Ecommerce Website with Django Backend

This project is a forked repository that originally contained only the frontend of an ecommerce website. I have added backend functionality using the Django framework. The backend is equipped with CRUD functionality, user management, real-time order management, and uses PostgreSQL as the database.

## Features

- **CRUD Functionality**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete products and other resources.
- **User Management**: User authentication and authorization.
- **Real-Time Order Management**: Handle orders in real-time.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Robust database for handling complex queries and large data sets.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/kpaatmik/Ecommerce.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd Ecommerce
    ```
3. Set up a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
        ```sh
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS and Linux:
        ```sh
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
5. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
6. Set up the database:
    ```sh
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```
7. Create a superuser to access the admin panel:
    ```sh
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
8. Run the development server:
    ```sh
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
